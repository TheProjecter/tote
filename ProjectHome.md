### It's Alive ###
Yes, I haven't done anything new on this page for a while, but commits are happening in the svn repository. Feel free to check it out if you want a developmental version of Tote

Note that Tote IS NOT in a stable state yet. It doesn't save things, and everything is likely to change as I work on it. The part that I am working on currently is located in Tote(svn)/src/newtote/. guiScratch.py will launch the gui.
